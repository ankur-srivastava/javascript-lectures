// If you have done any programming you will be at home with variables.
// If you haven't then don't worry it's quite easy to understand.
// Variables are used to store values. Value can be a string, a number or other forms of data.
// Let's understand this with an example. You may have seen websites that ask you to enter your first name etc.
// Now to store that name we need a variable.

let firstName = 'Ankur';

// Step 1 : Declare a Variable
// To use variables you need to declare them.
// We use keywords like let, var or const to declare variables.
// const is used to declare variables whose values do not change.

let age = 30;
const color = 'red';

// If we just write
let price;
console.log(price);

// It gives undefined

// Initialize a Variable
// Initialize means assigning a value to a variable.
let cost = 500;

// Variable Naming Rules
//
//   1. Don't use numbers at the start of variables. This is not allowed.
//   2. Variable names are case sensitive.
//   3. Using camelCase is safe and recommended.
//   4. Variable names should be intuitive.
//   5. Don't use the reserved words. That is words that are part of JS syntax. Like let, const, function etc.


// Variable Types
//
//   You don't need to specify variable types in JS. It's a dynamically typed language, quite similar to Python.
//   In other languages like C or Java you may have seen various data types being used like int, long, boolean, float etc. Not needed with JS.
//
//   You can store numbers, strings, booleans, arrays and objects.
//
//   Let's see some examples:

let message = 'Hello all';
let age=32;
let flag = false;
let a = [10, 12, 32]
